- Observation 1:
  - Most people wants Notifcations sent to them to remind them
  - Supporting Data: (I would forget and send daily notifications)(Sending notifications while im drinking to remind me to track would help since after a few drinks I would struggle to remember.)(I feel like an app with notifications to remind you could be helpful)
  - Team Action: make a daily notifcation reminder, and when they start drinking just have a counter on phone so they can easily track how many drinks they have until their limit

- Observation 2:
  - Most people in our focus group said they’d be most interested in features that actually show their progress, like visual graphs or budget tracking. It seems like users want to see real results and understand how their drinking habits are affecting them. 
  - Supporting Data: we had 39 responses, around 74% picked visual progress tracking and 71% picked budget tracking for alcohol spending. Those two clearly stood out the most compared to the other features.
  - Team Action: We decided to make the visual dashboard a main focus for our first version of the app. It’ll show weekly and monthly progress, spending habits, and trends so users can actually see how they’re doing instead of just reading numbers. Later on, we might include health tips or goals based on that data.

- Observation 3:
  - Many of our personas are motivated to track their alcohol spending, showing that financial awareness is a key reason people would use the app.
  - Supporting Data: Across 39 responses, budget tracking for alcohol spending was one of the most selected features, chosen by over 70% of respondents. Multiple participants specifically mentioned wanting to "see how much they have spent on alcohol" or to "add up how much people spend so they see what they could save." Even respondents who said they don’t drink noted that tracking spending would be "eye-opening for a lot of people."
  - Team Action: We’ll include a spending tracker in the app that shows weekly and monthly totals and estimated savings over time. The dashboard will visualize how cutting back on drinks saves money, and later we can connect this data with goals or positive feedback loops (like milestone rewards or alternative spending suggestions).
 
- Observation 4:
- Multiple people were concerned about remembering how much they drink.
- Supporting Data:
  - Question: “What challenges or concerns do you face when trying to keep track of your alcohol consumption, and how could an app make this easier for you?”
  - Responses: “I always forget,” “how do i remember when i'm actively under the influence,” “Remembering to track it,” “remembering how much I drank,” etc…
- Team Action: Implement notifications that are good at getting the user’s attention.

- Observation 5:
  - Observation Statement:
    Most respondents have never tried tracking their alcohol consumption and are not interested in doing so.
  - Supporting Data:
    According to the survey, 71.8% of participants (28 out of 39) selected “No, and I'm not interested.”
  - Team Action (if any):
    Consider reducing focus on features related to alcohol tracking for uninterested users. Instead, explore educational or motivational strategies that could highlight the benefits of awareness and self-monitoring.
