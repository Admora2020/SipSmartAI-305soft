Observation 1:
Most people wants Notifcations sent to them to remind them
Supporting Data: (I would forget and send daily notifications)(Sending notifications while im drinking to remind me to track would help since after a few drinks I would struggle to remember.)(I feel like an app with notifications to remind you could be helpful)
Team Action: make a daily notifcation reminder, and when they start drinking just have a counter on phone so they can easily track how many drinks they have until their limit
