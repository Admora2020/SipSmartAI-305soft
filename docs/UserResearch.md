Observation 1:
Most people wants Notifcations sent to them to remind them
Supporting Data: (I would forget and send daily notifications)(Sending notifications while im drinking to remind me to track would help since after a few drinks I would struggle to remember.)(I feel like an app with notifications to remind you could be helpful)
Team Action: make a daily notifcation reminder, and when they start drinking just have a counter on phone so they can easily track how many drinks they have until their limit

Observation 2:
Most people in our focus group said they’d be most interested in features that actually show their progress, like visual graphs or budget tracking. It seems like users want to see real results and understand how their drinking habits are affecting them. Supporting Data we had 39 responses, around 74% picked visual progress tracking and 71% picked budget tracking for alcohol spending. Those two clearly stood out the most compared to the other features.
Team Action:
We decided to make the visual dashboard a main focus for our first version of the app. It’ll show weekly and monthly progress, spending habits, and trends so users can actually see how they’re doing instead of just reading numbers. Later on, we might include health tips or goals based on that data.
