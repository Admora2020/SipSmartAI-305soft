# 305Soft Team Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders of this class project team, we pledge to create a respectful, inclusive, and productive environment where every member feels valued and heard.

We are committed to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We will act and interact in ways that build trust, collaboration, and mutual learning throughout the 5–8 week project.

## 305Soft Policy: Technology Use

To maintain engagement and respect during all meetings and collaborative sessions, **no distracted use of technology** (e.g., texting, scrolling, unrelated device use) is allowed.  
Phones should remain away or on silent unless directly relevant to the project task at hand.  
Violations will result in a gentle reminder, and continued misuse may affect participation credit.

---

## Decision-Making

Our team will use **consensus** whenever possible, ensuring every voice is heard and considered.  
When consensus cannot be reached, a **majority vote** will decide the matter.  
Leaders or designated facilitators will ensure discussions stay balanced and solution-focused.

---

## Attendance

### Expectations

- Members must attend all scheduled team meetings, whether virtual or in person.  
- Notify the team at least **24 hours in advance** if you cannot attend (unless due to an emergency).  
- Three or more unexcused absences may result in a review of your participation grade or reassignment of tasks.

### Making Up Missed Meetings

- Review meeting notes and action items shared after each session.  
- Communicate with a teammate to clarify next steps and deliverables.  
- Complete any missed work within **48 hours** of the meeting.

---

## Assignments

- Tasks will be assigned based on member strengths, interests, and availability.  
- Members are expected to complete work on time and with care.  

If a member submits poor-quality or incomplete work, the team will:

1. Offer private feedback and guidance for improvement.  
2. Redistribute tasks temporarily if the issue continues.  
3. Document repeated issues for the instructor if unresolved.

---

## Participation and Collaboration

- Communication will occur through agreed-upon channels (e.g., GroupMe, Slack, Discord, or email).  
- Each member is encouraged to contribute ideas and feedback consistently.  
- To ensure full participation, roles (e.g., note-taker, presenter, coder, designer) will **rotate weekly**.  
- Team members will honor one another’s unique strengths and encourage leadership from all.

---

## Meeting Times and Locations

- Meeting times and locations will be chosen based on collective availability via a shared poll.  
- Virtual meetings will be held on the team’s designated platform (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, or Discord).  
- In-person meetings will begin promptly; remote members must log in **5 minutes early** to ensure setup.

---

## Agenda and Minutes / Notes

- A rotating note-taker will document meeting minutes, including decisions, next steps, and assigned tasks.  
- Notes will be shared in a shared document or group chat within **24 hours** after each meeting.  
- The facilitator will confirm agenda items at the start of each meeting and summarize action items at the end.

---

## Promptness

- Members are expected to arrive on time to all meetings and check-ins.  
- Repeated lateness (3 or more times) without valid reason may result in reduced participation credit.  
- If late, message the team before the meeting begins.

---

## Conversational Courtesies

- Practice active listening and avoid interrupting others.  
- Share airtime—no one voice should dominate the discussion.  
- Stay on topic; gently redirect tangents back to project goals.  
- Use “I” statements and express disagreements respectfully.  
- Assume good intent, but also take responsibility for impact.

---

## Enforcement and Feedback

- The team will address issues privately first, encouraging reflection and accountability.  
- For ongoing or serious issues, a group discussion with the instructor may occur.  
- Feedback will be given constructively and respectfully, focusing on behavior, not personality.  
- Members should express how they prefer to receive feedback (verbally, in writing, etc.).  
- All reports will remain confidential unless escalation is necessary.

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (e.g., team lead, instructor) will clarify and enforce these standards fairly.  
They may remove or edit contributions that violate this Code of Conduct and communicate reasons for doing so when appropriate.

---

## Scope

This Code applies to all team activities—meetings, online communications, shared documents, and public representations of the project.
