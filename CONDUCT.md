# 305Soft Team Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members of the 305Soft project team, we pledge to create a collaborative, inclusive, and respectful environment throughout the 5–8 week development process.  
We commit to ensuring that every contributor—regardless of experience, background, or identity—feels valued, supported, and heard.

We strive to make participation in our project a harassment-free and growth-focused experience for everyone.  
This includes respecting all individuals regardless of age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We aim to work as a **Scrum team**, emphasizing transparency, communication, and continuous improvement over hierarchy or competition.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

- Showing empathy, patience, and support toward others  
- Respecting all viewpoints and seeking to understand before judging  
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback with professionalism  
- Taking accountability for one’s own actions and contributions  
- Focusing on what benefits the team and project, not just individual preferences  
- Celebrating progress, learning, and innovation  

### Unacceptable Behaviors

- Disrespectful, dismissive, or exclusionary language or actions  
- Personal or political attacks, public or private harassment  
- Spreading misinformation or disclosing confidential discussions  
- Ignoring Scrum agreements or disrupting collaborative flow  
- Discriminatory behavior or communication of any kind  

---

## Technology and Focus Policy (305Soft Policy)

To respect team time and maintain focus, **no distracted use of technology** (e.g., unrelated phone use, texting, social media) is permitted during meetings or Scrum events.  
Devices should only be used for project purposes—GitHub updates, note-taking, or referencing documentation.  
Repeat distractions may lead to a formal team discussion and documentation on the project board.

---

## Decision-Making

305Soft follows a **Scrum-based decision process** grounded in collaboration and consensus.  

- All decisions are discussed openly during meetings or on GitHub.  
- When consensus cannot be reached, the team will use a majority vote.  
- The Scrum Master facilitates discussion but holds no hierarchical authority.  
- Decisions are recorded on the relevant GitHub PBI card or sprint note for transparency.

---

## Attendance

### Expectations

- All members must attend scheduled Scrum events (e.g., stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives) and team meetings.  
- Notify the group at least **24 hours in advance** if you cannot attend.  
- Emergencies or health issues are legitimate reasons for absence, but communication is expected.

### Making Up Missed Meetings

- Review updates on GitHub and in the group chat immediately after missing a session.  
- Catch up on PBI assignments or notes within **48 hours**.  
- Consistent absences without notice may result in task reassignment and documentation in sprint feedback.

---

## Assignments

- Tasks are assigned during sprint planning and tracked through GitHub Project PBI cards.  
- Assignments are made based on member skills, interests, and sprint goals.  
- Team members are expected to meet agreed-upon deadlines and maintain code quality.  

If a member consistently fails to complete or poorly completes work:

1. A private discussion will occur between the Scrum Master and the member.  
2. The issue will be documented on GitHub for transparency.  
3. The team will decide how to redistribute workload or escalate if necessary.

---

## Participation and Communication

- Our primary communication tools are **GitHub** (for tasks, issues, and documentation) and a **group chat** (for scheduling, reminders, and quick updates).  
- Everyone is expected to participate in discussions, code reviews, and retrospectives.  
- **Scrum values—Commitment, Courage, Focus, Openness, and Respect—guide how we interact.**  
- The Scrum Master ensures equal voice and maintains healthy team dynamics.

---

## Agenda and Minutes / Notes

- In place of traditional meeting minutes, all updates, issues, and decisions are documented directly in the **GitHub Scrum Project Board**.  
- Any issue, concern, or new task raised during discussion will be added as a **PBI (Product Backlog Item)** card for tracking.  
- These cards will reflect current status, assigned members, and next steps.  
- Team communication will flow through both GitHub and our group chat for coordination outside class hours.  

Since Scrum promotes self-organization, there are no formal leaders—the Scrum Master facilitates process flow, but all members share responsibility for keeping documentation current.  
Meeting agendas are confirmed at the start of each session, and all action items are logged on GitHub by day’s end.

---

## Promptness

- Members are expected to be on time for every Scrum meeting or class work session.  
- If running late, notify the group chat as soon as possible.  
- Repeated lateness will be noted in sprint reviews and may affect participation evaluation.

---

## Conversational Courtesies

- Practice active listening—avoid interrupting or dismissing others’ ideas.  
- Maintain respectful dialogue even when disagreeing.  
- Avoid monopolizing airtime; encourage contributions from quieter members.  
- Stay on topic; off-topic tangents should be moved to the end or side discussions.  
- Use “Yes, and…” or “I see your point…” statements to build collaboration.

---

## Enforcement and Feedback

- All Scrum members share responsibility for upholding this Code of Conduct.  
- Feedback is given constructively, focusing on actions and outcomes—not personal traits.  
- If issues arise, they will be addressed privately first, then logged in GitHub if unresolved.  
- Feedback preferences (verbal, written, or GitHub comments) will be respected.  
- Serious or repeated violations may be reported to the instructor for mediation.

---

## Scope

This Code applies to all interactions within the 305Soft project—meetings, class sessions, GitHub communications, and any public representation of the team.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant, version 2.1**  
and inspired by the **Scrum Values** and **Google’s team collaboration principles** emphasizing shared accountability, inclusion, and transparency.  
Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by **Mozilla’s Code of Conduct Enforcement Ladder**.
